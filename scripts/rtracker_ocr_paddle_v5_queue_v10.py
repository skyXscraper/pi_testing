"""Roll tracking + OCR (PP-OCRv5 mobile) with an ordered result queue that drives the ESP32 bin lights -- queue v10.
New in v10: the annotated video separates live reading from final results (reading, votes and decisions unchanged):
  text boxes      each ply / range / text box shows the LATEST raw OCR read of that box ('ply: 7841-DW 0.93'), which
                  changes with every read (no voting). Reads lag the video a little: the OCR workers read queued crops
                  of earlier frames. A box is matched to its reads by its position relative to the roll's centre.
  roll boxes      only '#track seq N' and the state colour (orange reading, green picked, red no bin)
  top panel       fixed height, shows the queue at work:
                    line 1   fps + the LAST final result: seq, roll, ply | range -> bin / status
                    line 2   the queue, one chip per roll in seq order: 'next' marks the roll being decided,
                             P/R/T = its crops still waiting (ply / range / text), 'left' = roll left the frame;
                             orange = reading, green / red = decided, waiting to be reported in seq order
                    1 line per OCR worker (--ocr-workers): the crop it is reading now (roll, field, frame, ms so
                    far) or idle, and its last read (text, score, ms)
  results_table.csv  in the test log folder: one row per decided roll, written when it is decided, with the video
                  frame / time it appeared on the panel and the last raw reads at that moment
Everything below is queue v9's description, unchanged:
New in v9: the text recognizer can run on the Hailo-8L too -- two .hef files on one chip:
  --rec-model x.hef  recognizer on the Hailo (ocr_hailo_v1.HailoReader, characters from x_chars.txt or --rec-chars)
  --rec-model x.onnx recognizer on the CPU (ONNX Runtime), exactly as v8
  one Hailo device   when the detector and/or the recognizer is a .hef, one VDevice with the HailoRT scheduler
                     (detector_v3.open_hailo_device) is shared; the scheduler switches the chip between the models
Reading, votes and decisions are unchanged from v8 (single text class support included). Uses detector_v3.py.
Everything below is queue v8's description, unchanged:
New in v8: works with a detector that has ONE text class (both text boxes of a roll labelled "ply"), next to the
old ply / range / roll detectors. Uses detector_v2.py, which maps the model's classes by name:
  single text class  every text box is queued as "text"; its way up comes from reading it both ways (the ply-above-
                     range layout needs to know which box is which); after the read, the TEXT decides the field:
                     '.' or number-number -> range ('50.8-78.3', '31.3.37.1', '44-46'), digits with or without
                     U/D W/B -> ply ('1511', '7841-DW', '85W'); anything else is only logged (no vote).
                     From there on the votes, confirmations and decision rules are exactly those of queue v7.
  ply / range model  unchanged from v7 (fields and way up from the detector classes).
  --classes          class names of a .hef in training order when it is neither ply,range,roll nor ply,roll
  --merge-text       treat ply and range boxes as one text class even if the model has both classes
  ocr_reads.csv      field column: "text:ply" / "text:range" / "text:-" for single-class boxes
Everything below is queue v7's description, unchanged:
Same reading as rtracker_ocr_paddle_v5_queue_v6.py (free reading of every box, fine-tuned model, no threshold,
read ahead + --ocr-workers), with its own rules for WHEN and HOW a roll is decided:
  early (green)   as soon as a ply value is CONFIRMED (--votes matching reads, or fast confirm) and its digits are
                  in master.csv, the roll is decided at once: bin picked and lit, box turns green on the overlay.
                  Case 3 also needs a confirmed range read within --range-max-diff of one of the ply's sheet
                  ranges (the closest one is used). Several such plys: the one confirmed last.
                  Once decided, no more crops of the roll are queued.
  otherwise       (confirmed but not in the sheet, e.g. '7' while '72' is being written; or nothing confirmed yet)
                  reading goes on over every frame, also after the roll has left, and the roll is decided with the
                  rules below once it has left (--close-after frames unseen) or --read-timeout has run out AND all its
                  crops are read:
  ply (end)       among the ply reads whose digits are in master.csv, the MOST RECENT read (latest video frame)
                  wins, even if read only once. None in the sheet: the latest confirmed value -> not in master.
                  Nothing confirmed either: UNREADABLE.
  range (end)     among ALL range reads of the roll, the one closest to one of the ply's sheet ranges wins (fewest
                  differing digits, at most --range-max-diff), even if read only once; tie -> the most reads.
Rolls are still decided, lit and reported strictly in seq order: a roll confirmed early waits for the rolls before
it to be decided first.
  clean crops     crops are cut from an untouched copy of the frame (no drawn boxes / ROI border in them).
Kept from v6: whole dictionary, no character restriction, no format check, no dot-to-dash fix, the whole read is
the value and only the sheet lookup uses its digits ('85W' -> '85'), every non-empty read is a vote, both ways up
read and logged when the layout does not give the way up, 'auto' boxes (text-only mode) only logged, every read
crop saved.
How the chosen ply picks its bin in master.csv
(a ply may have several rows, one per bin):

  case 1  ply has one row                 -> that bin
  case 2  all its rows have the same range -> first unused bin in the order Before-DW, Before-UW, After-DW, After-UW (relay 1..4),
          (ranges within --range-tol count as the same, e.g. 2.75-19.2 and 2.8-19.2)
  case 3  its rows have different ranges   -> the range read closest to one of its sheet ranges (at most
          --range-max-diff differing digits), then the first unused bin in that range
Every bin row is used once: a roll that would need an already used row is a DUPLICATE (terminal only, no light).
Type `reset` + Enter in the terminal to clear the used rows for the next set of rolls.
Not in master, range not readable, range matching no row, UNREADABLE: terminal only, lights unchanged.
The lit bin stays on until the next roll lights one; the same bin again is switched off and on.

  crops/          every crop that was read, as PNG
  results.csv     one row per roll, same columns as --csv
  results_table.csv  one row per decided roll as shown on the video's top panel (+ decision frame / video time)
  annotated.mp4   the annotated video (unless --out is given)
  summary.txt     totals and average speeds, written at the end (also on q / Ctrl-C)
--no-log turns it off (no crops saved; annotated video then goes to output/annotated_queue_v10.mp4).
